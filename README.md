- Run ``npm install`` and ``npx expo install`` in the terminal in order to install all the project's dependencies.
- Run "npx expo start" in the terminal in order to start the project.
- Go to the Expo Go app and scan the QR displayed in the terminal to test the app,
  or type "w" in the terminal to display it on a web browser (additional dependencies might be required to be intalled for this last option).
